# Graduate University Recommendation

This project is Graduate University Recommender which helps students choose their graduate school that comply with their requirements.

It is an intelligent system which takes input from the user such as their GPA and Test scores and returns a list of universities categorized in three categories namely safe, moderate and ambitious.This intelligent system works like a counselor.   

Safe universities are those in which the student has highest chances of getting
in. Moderate universities are those in which student has medium chances of
getting in. Ambitious universities are those in which student has lowest chance
of getting in.
   
  
There is a list of universities in our database and their requirements which have been
collected from the ‘Yocket’ app based on previous admits to that particular
university.

This project is implemented in prolog using s(ASP) system.
